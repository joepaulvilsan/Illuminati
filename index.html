      <h3>DAY 1</h3>
      <p>Today I had this program called Mpower, I didn't had any idea about how the program would be so i wore a casual dress and went for the program with a least expectation and excitement. The class handled by "krishna kumar" Sir, who had taken more than 190 classes and yet he came to give us his class within his busy schedule. His classes were interesting and mostly not at all boring. The topic was about placement, Resume, and other interviews and interviewe things. He made the class excitement, fun and mainly enthusiastic. He made each of us talk in a platform and gave us points for each groups. He made each of us responsible by giving a group and showing us how to take responsibility and gave us points by asking questions and playing games . In the morning section we played a game bouncing ball and after lunch break we played another game. We enjoyed each and every moment . The session ended at 4 pm. Their multiple activities made us confident and energetic.</p>
